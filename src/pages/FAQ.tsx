    question: "What data sources does F1 Analytics use?",
    answer: "F1 Analytics primarily uses the FastF1 Python library, which accesses publicly available Formula 1 timing data, weather data, and session information. Data accuracy is dependent on these upstream sources.",
  },
  {
    question: "How often is the data updated?",
    answer: "Historical data (results, standings, charts) is pre-processed and cached by the backend script. The backend script needs to be run periodically to update historical data for completed events.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is F1 Analytics affiliated with Formula 1?",
    answer: "No, F1 Analytics is an independent project and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or associated with Formula One group companies. F1, FORMULA ONE, FORMULA 1, FIA FORMULA ONE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP, GRAND PRIX and related marks are trade marks of Formula One Licensing B.V.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why is some data missing or unavailable?",
    answer: "Data availability depends on the upstream sources accessed by the FastF1 library. Sometimes, specific telemetry channels or historical data points might not be available for certain sessions or years. Additionally, the backend processor script must be run successfully to generate cached data.",
  },

    question: "How can I report a bug or suggest a feature?",
